Decision trees par--on the data into subsets based on the selected features, with each par--on represen-ng a node in the tree.  How It Works  The algorithm recursively splits the dataset into smaller subsets based on the most inﬂuen-al features at each node. It selects the feature that best separates the data points, crea-ng branches that represent diﬀerent outcomes. The process con-nues un-l the algorithm iden-ﬁes the best possible outcome, or un-l a stopping criterion is met. The resul-ng structure resembles a tree, with branches represen-ng decisions and leaves represen-ng the ﬁnal outcome or predic-on.

It is widely used for supervised learning tasks, including classiﬁca2on, regression, and ranking problems. XGBoost builds an ensemble of weak predic2on models, typically decision trees, to create a strong predic2ve model with high accuracy and generalizability.  How It Works  XGBoost sequen2ally builds a strong model by adding weak models that collec2vely minimize a predeﬁned loss func2on. It uses gradient boos2ng to op2mize the model by ﬁGng new models to the residuals of the previous models. XGBoost employs a combina2on of regulariza2on techniques and parallel processing to enhance model performance and reduce overﬁGng.  Mathema)cal Intui)on  XGBoost op2mizes the objec2ve func2on by compu2ng the ﬁrst and second deriva2ves of the loss func2on. It uses the Taylor series expansion to approximate the loss func2on, leading to a simpliﬁed yet eﬀec2ve op2miza2on process. XGBoost u2lizes techniques like gradient descent and tree pruning to eﬃciently handle complex datasets and achieve beKer generaliza2on. Limita)ons  Although XGBoost is known for its robustness and high performance, it can be computa2onally expensive and memory-intensive, par2cularly for large datasets.

operations that can be applied to filter the data.\n\nIn this case, the user's query is \"What are songs that were not published on Spotify\". Based on the provided data source, we can identify the following attributes:\n\n* artist\n* length\n* genre\n\nWe can also identify the logical operations that can be applied to filter the data:\n\n* and (logical conjunction)\n* or (logical disjunction)\n\nBased on the user's query, we can construct the following structured request:\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"\",\n    \"filter\": \"and(or(eq(\\\"artist\\\", \\\"Taylor Swift\\\"), or(eq(\\\"artist\\\", \\\"Katy Perry\\\")))), NO_FILTER\"\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The query string is empty because the user did not provide any text to compare with the document contents.\n* The filter string is \"and(or(eq(\\\"artist\\\", \\\"Taylor Swift\\\"), or(eq(\\\"artist\\\", \\\"Katy Perry\\\")))), NO_FILTER\". This filter applies the logical operation \"and\" (logical conjunction) to the two comparison statements. The first statement compares the \"artist\" attribute with \"Taylor Swift\", and the second statement compares the \"artist\" attribute with \"Katy Perry\". Both statements must be true for the document to match the filter. The \"NO_FILTER\" value is returned if there are no filters that should be applied.\n\nNote: In this example, we only used the logical operators and (logical conjunction) and or (logical disjunction) listed in the request schema. We did not use any other operators or attributes.\n raised following error:\nReceived invalid attributes artist.
