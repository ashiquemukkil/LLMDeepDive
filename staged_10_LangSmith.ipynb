( META ) \\nSecond Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call  \\nJuly 26th, 202 3 \\n \\nKen Dorell , Director , Investor Relations  \\n \\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platforms second quarter 2023 earnings conference \\ncall. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Susan Li, CFO.  \\n \\nBefore we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will \\ninclude forward‐looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from t hose contemplated by \\nthese forward‐looking statements.  \\n \\nFactors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s press release, and in \\nour quarterly report on form 10 -Q filed with the SEC. Any forward‐looking statements that we make on \\nthis call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these \\nstatements as a result of new information or future events.  \\n \\nDuring this call we will present both GAAP and certain non‐GAAP financial measures. A reconci liation of \\nGAAP to non‐GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The press release and an \\naccompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.  \\n \\nAnd now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.  \\n \\nMark Zuckerb erg, CEO  \\n \\nThanks Ken, and thanks everyone for joining.  \\n  \\nThis was a good quarter for our business. We're seeing strong engagement trends across our apps. \\nThere are now more than 3.8 billion people who use at least one of our apps every month. Facebook \\nnow has more than 3 billion monthly actives -- with daily actives continuing to grow around the world, \\nincluding in the US and Canada.  \\n \\nIn addition to our core products performing well, I think we have the most exciting roadmap ahead that \\nI've se en in a while. We've got continued progress on Threads, Reels, Llama 2, and some ground -\\nbreaking AI products in the pipeline as well as the Quest 3 launch com ing up this fall. We're heads down \\nexecuting on all of this right now, and it's really good to see the decisions and investments that we've \\nmade start to play out.  \\n \\nOn Threads, briefly, I'm quite optimistic about our trajectory. We saw unprecedented growth out of the \\ngate and more importantly we're seeing more people coming back daily than I'd expected. And now, \\nwe're focuse d on retention and improving the basics. And then a fter that, we'll focus on growing the \\ncommunity to the scale we think is possible. Only after that will we work on monetization. We've run \\nthis playbook many times before -- with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Stories, Reels, and more -- and \\nthis is as good of a start as we could have hoped for, so I'm really happy with the path we're on here.    \\n \\nOne note  that I want to mention about the Threads launch related to our Year of Efficiency is that the \\nproduct was built by a relatively small team on a tight timeline.
